 *     a highly compressible string table.) Smaller buffer sizes give

     *      The PKZIP "deflate" file format interprets compressed file data

     *      byte boundaries without restriction.
     *
     *      The first bit of each byte is the low-order bit.
     *
     *      The routines in this file allow a variable-length bit value to
     *      be output right-to-left (useful for literal values). For
     *      left-to-right output (useful for code strings from the tree routines),
     *      the bits must have been reversed first with bi_reverse().
     *
     *      For in-memory compression, the compressed bit stream goes directly
     *      into the requested output buffer. The input data is read in blocks
     *      by the mem_read() function. The buffer is limited to 64K on 16 bit

     *      which is itself a Huffman encoding of the lengths of
     *      all the code strings (in ascending order by source values).
     *      The actual code strings are reconstructed from the lengths in

     *  deflate.c by Jean-loup Gailly.
     *
     *  PURPOSE
     *
     *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
     *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
     *
     *  DISCUSSION
     *
     *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
     *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
     *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
     *
     *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
     *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
     *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
     *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
     *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
     *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
     *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
     *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
     *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
     *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
     *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
     *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
     *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
     *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
     *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
     *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
     *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
     *
     *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
     *
     *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
     *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
     *      Thanks to many info-zippers for bug reports and testing.
